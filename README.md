Transformers summarization - Code implementation of ["Transformers: State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03771)


## This repository is a use case for using NLP pipeline in Transformers to summarize the top yelp reviews for a given business and limiting the output response to 60 characters. 

You can obtain your own API key here: [Yelp Developer Portal](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/)

I was inspired to build this model after searching through countless yelp reviews to get a good summary of the restaurant I was interested in and wanted to create my own pipeline to do the work for me. 

### Updated 12/23/22
Added book summarization analysis using the [Amazon Book Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews?resource=download)
